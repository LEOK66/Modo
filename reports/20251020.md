# Team Report

## Last Week’s Goals
- The frontend team should implement the login and register page implementation and skelonton view for the whole app
- The backend team should implement the login and register logic and make sure it works as expected

## Progress and Issues
Accomplishments:
- frontend team did a greate job on implementing the UI as they designed, and most of the functionality works on one try.
- Successfully designed our system, and showed to the TA.
- Understood the structure of IOS development, be ready for later progress.

Challenges:

- Did not get much from the backend, the communication needs to be improved.

## Plans and Goals for the Next Week
Frontend Team (Zihao, Oliver, Harry):

- Implement the setup page to gather information
- Make sure it works as expected, and it can move to the main page flawlessly
- Finalize the whole app skeleton, make sure the flow is set

Backend Team (Maya, Shelby):

- Finish the login and register logic
- Coorperate with the frontend, make sure the data setup functionality works
- Set up the AI endpoint and figure it out the work flow for our AI funcitonality.

Product & Testing (Leo):

- Conduct daily integration testing of signup → onboarding → profile flow
- Coordinate staging deployment between frontend and backend teams
- Document bugs and facilitate debugging sessions

# Contributions of Individual Team Members

## Member 1: Leo

### Last Week’s Goals
- *(Copy from last week’s “Plans and goals for the next week.” Leave empty for the first week.)*

### Progress and Issues

- Finalized the documentation for the deisgn
- Started the design and finished and shown to the TA
- Assigned task to team members and held the meeting to answer questions
- fixed some of the bugs in the UI
- Manage the repo make sure the work flow is on the track

### Plans and Goals for the Next Week

- Refine our design so that it can be more clear and understandble
- Have more communication with the two teams, make them work together more often
- continuously monitoring the repo, fix bugs as usual
- Held team meeting to track the progress, make sure the deadline still hit.


## Member 2: Zihao

### Last Week’s Goals
- Implement the beginner interface (first screen users see when opening the app)
  - Create login, password recovery, and register interfaces (2 days)
  - Implement interactions between these interfaces (2 days)
  - Collaborate with backend to connect requests and responses (2 days)

### Progress and Issues
- Became familiar with Xcode’s workflow and successfully deployed the iOS virtual machine for testing  
- Completed implementation of the **Login** and **Forgot Password** pages  
- Merged and modified Oliver’s **Register** page, adding a **resend code countdown** feature  
- Standardized the GitHub UI file structure:  
  - Organized all individual page files  
  - Added a `component` file for reusable elements (e.g., buttons)  
- Coordinated with the backend team to finalize login request and response logic  
- **Issue:** Apple login cannot be tested properly on the virtual machine, might need to use real iphone to test functionality

### Plans and Goals for the Next Week
- Implement the setup page, and make sure it connected with the backend database operation. (2days)
- Help with the main app skeleton build up. (4days)


## Member 3: Harry

### Last Week’s Goals

### Progress and Issues
- Helped review and finalize the core feature set to align frontend priorities with overall vision of app
- Set up local development environment, Git workflow, and Xcode project structure
  - Learned basics of SwiftUI layout and state management from onboarding documentation
  - Established Git branching workflow and tested feature branch creation
- Learned how Figma designs translate into SwiftUI components and began planning the navigation hierarchy
- Faced some initial uncertainty on feature prioritization and on a standout feature when discussing design

### Plans and Goals for the Next Week
- finalize the main page skeleton implementation (7 days)
- Join the discussion of what kinda data exactly goes to each component(7 days)


## Member 4: Oliver

### Last Week’s Goals

### Progress and Issues
- What I did:
  - Designed multiple UI screens in Figma, including home page, profile page, progress page, settings page, add task page, and calendar modal
  - Refined design philosophy from purple theme to minimalist black-white-gray color scheme
  - Implemented consistent component library with unified spacing, rounded corners, and typography
  - Created interactive prototypes demonstrating screen transitions and user flows
- What worked:
  - The simplified black-white-gray color palette created a more premium aesthetic compared to the initial purple theme
  - Using Figma component variants and auto-layout significantly improved design consistency across screens
  - Collaboration with PM (Leo) and design team (Zihao, Harry) helped iterate quickly on feedback
- What I learned:
  - How to use Figma advanced features including component variants, auto-layout, and prototyping interactions
  - The importance of color psychology in creating a premium feel - sometimes less is more
  - How to balance functional design with aesthetic appeal
- Where I had trouble:
  - Initial purple color scheme felt too complex and not premium enough
  - Took time to master Figma's component system and prototyping tools
- Where I am stuck:
  - None currently - design phase is complete and ready to move into implementation

### Plans and Goals for the Next Week
- Same with Harry.



## Member 5: Maya

### Last Week’s Goals
- *(Copy from last week’s “Plans and goals for the next week.” Leave empty for the first week.)*

### Progress and Issues
- Discuss with the team about the data flow
- Understand basic features and functionality needs to implement
- Learned how firebase works and its internal tools to help build the projects
### Plans and Goals for the Next Week
- Implement the authentication log in and sign up features (3 days)
- Coorperate with frontened to deliver best results (2 days)
- Design the system chart (1 day)


## Member 6: Shelby

### Last Week’s Goals
- Finalize fire symbol scaling algorithm by defining scaling formula based on completed goals (2 days)
- Update database for backend streak data integration into the dashboard (3 days)
- Enable the filtering of dashboard by goal types (workout, nutrition, both) and completion status (all, partial, none) (2 days)
- Verify offline mode retrieves cached streak history and ensure proper prompts appear when backend is unreachable (1 day)

### Progress and Issues
- Drew out the architecture workflow for the backend
- Learning how firebase works and setting it up with our app took longer than expected
- I implemented the sign in, sign out, and sign up features using firebase
- Need to understand what the desired features are as we changed things after our first round of feedback from TA


### Plans and Goals for the Next Week
- Understand the individual user data that needs to be stored and implement that system into firebase (2 days)
- Implement the data streak storage that tracks user history in order to earn badges and rewards (3 days)
- Ensure that each user’s data remains confidential and specific to them/their profile (2 days)

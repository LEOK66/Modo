# Team Report

## Last Week’s Goals
- The frontend team should implement the login and register page implementation and skelonton view for the whole app
- The backend team should implement the login and register logic and make sure it works as expected

## Progress and Issues
Accomplishments:
- frontend team did a greate job on implementing the UI as they designed, and most of the functionality works on one try.
- Successfully designed our system, and showed to the TA.
- Understood the structure of IOS development, be ready for later progress.

Challenges:

- Did not get much from the backend, the communication needs to be improved.

## Plans and Goals for the Next Week
Frontend Team (Zihao, Oliver, Harry):

- Implement the setup page to gather information
- Make sure it works as expected, and it can move to the main page flawlessly
- Finalize the whole app skeleton, make sure the flow is set

Backend Team (Maya, Shelby):

- Finish the login and register logic
- Coorperate with the frontend, make sure the data setup functionality works
- Set up the AI endpoint and figure it out the work flow for our AI funcitonality.

Product & Testing (Leo):

- Conduct daily integration testing of signup → onboarding → profile flow
- Coordinate staging deployment between frontend and backend teams
- Document bugs and facilitate debugging sessions

# Contributions of Individual Team Members

## Member 1: Leo

### Last Week’s Goals
- *(Copy from last week’s “Plans and goals for the next week.” Leave empty for the first week.)*

### Progress and Issues

- Finalized the documentation for the deisgn
- Started the design and finished and shown to the TA
- Assigned task to team members and held the meeting to answer questions
- fixed some of the bugs in the UI
- Manage the repo make sure the work flow is on the track

### Plans and Goals for the Next Week

- Refine our design so that it can be more clear and understandble
- Have more communication with the two teams, make them work together more often
- continuously monitoring the repo, fix bugs as usual
- Held team meeting to track the progress, make sure the deadline still hit.


## Member 2: Zihao

### Last Week’s Goals
- Implement the beginner interface (first screen users see when opening the app)
  - Create login, password recovery, and register interfaces (2 days)
  - Implement interactions between these interfaces (2 days)
  - Collaborate with backend to connect requests and responses (2 days)

### Progress and Issues
- Became familiar with Xcode’s workflow and successfully deployed the iOS virtual machine for testing  
- Completed implementation of the **Login** and **Forgot Password** pages  
- Merged and modified Oliver’s **Register** page, adding a **resend code countdown** feature  
- Standardized the GitHub UI file structure:  
  - Organized all individual page files  
  - Added a `component` file for reusable elements (e.g., buttons)  
- Coordinated with the backend team to finalize login request and response logic  
- **Issue:** Apple login cannot be tested properly on the virtual machine, might need to use real iphone to test functionality

### Plans and Goals for the Next Week
- Implement the setup page, and make sure it connected with the backend database operation. (2days)
- Help with the main app skeleton build up that Harry built. (2days)
- Help with the main app skeleton build up that Oliver built. (2days)


## Member 3: Harry

### Last Week’s Goals
- Implement main navigation and tab structure
  - Set up tab view for Dashboard, Calendar, AI Chat, and Settings (1.5 days)
  - Connect navigation flow between each page (0.5 days)
  - Integrate Figma design system into SwiftUI components (1 day)
### Progress and Issues
- Completed all planned goals for the week, including setting up the main navigation, tab structure, and integrating the Figma design system into SwiftUI components.
- Encountered several bugs in the skeleton code (navigation not working, misplaced UI elements, etc.), which required extra debugging to ensure the navigation and UI worked as intended.
- Spent additional time learning more about SwiftUI, including layout, state management, and best practices, to improve implementation quality and accelerate future development.

### Plans and Goals for the Next Week
- Finalize the main page skeleton implementation (7 days)
- Join the discussion of what kinda data exactly goes to each component(7 days)


## Member 4: Oliver

### Last Week’s Goals
- Work with Zihao to complete the login section implementation
- Implement register page and related authentication components (2 days)
- Help finalize the main app skeleton structure

### Progress and Issues
- What I did:
  - Completed the Register page implementation in collaboration with Zihao
  - Built out Profile interface sub-pages:
    - Support and Help page
    - Three interfaces within the Progress section
  - Successfully integrated these pages into the overall app skeleton
- What worked:
  - The register page functionality worked smoothly and integrated well with Zihao's login components
  - Profile interface pages maintained design consistency with the Figma mockups
- What I learned:
  - Gained deeper understanding of SwiftUI navigation and state management between multiple pages
- Where I had trouble:
  - Ensuring consistent styling across all new pages required careful attention to detail

### Plans and Goals for the Next Week
- Same with Harry.
- Optimize and refine the Profile sub-pages completed this week (Support/Help and Progress interfaces) (2 days)
- Connect my pages with other team members' implemented pages to ensure smooth navigation flow (2 days)
- Implement Settings page within Profile section and its sub-pages (2 days)
- Implement Achievement page within Profile section and its related sub-pages (1 day)



## Member 5: Maya

### Last Week’s Goals
- *(Copy from last week’s “Plans and goals for the next week.” Leave empty for the first week.)*

### Progress and Issues
- Discuss with the team about the data flow
- Understand basic features and functionality needs to implement
- Learned how firebase works and its internal tools to help build the projects
### Plans and Goals for the Next Week
- Implement the authentication log in and sign up features (3 days)
- Coorperate with frontened to deliver best results (2 days)

### Progress and Issues
- Drew out the architecture workflow for the backend
- Learning how firebase works and setting it up with our app took longer than expected

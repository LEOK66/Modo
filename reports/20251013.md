I defined the actors, triggers, preconditions, postconditions, and success scenario for the streak tracking use case. This included detailing the step-by-step flow for logging activity, checking goals, and displaying streaks with fire symbols. I also outlined the extensions and variations where users can filter by goal type or completion, and the exceptions in which behavior does not work as intended.

The success scenario clearly shows the interaction between the user, AI, and backend. The fire symbol mechanic effectively conveys streak progress visually. Furthermore, the ability to filter by goal type or completion status adds flexibility to the dashboard.

Defining clear preconditions and postconditions ensures the system behaves predictably. Including AI feedback recommendations based on streak data can enhance user engagement. Exception handling is crucial for real-world usage so we need to be sure to know how to handle offline mode, empty history, and world.

There is the issue of correctly visualizing how the fire symbol scales dynamically with goal completion. And I am unsure if there are other factors regarding this “streak tracker” system where badges will also be rewarded in other instances that were not accounted for. We also need to figure out how AI feedback should integrate without overwhelming the user.

We need to figure out the algorithm for scaling fire symbols based on multiple goal completions. We also need to decide the backend data structure decisions to efficiently store and retrieve streak history for AI analysis.

### Plans and Goals for the Next Week

  - *(If tasks roll over, explain blockers and update estimates.)*
1. Finalize Fire Symbol Scaling Algorithm (Estimated time: 2 days)
Define formula for scaling based on number of completed goals.
Implement prototype visualization for testing.

2. Backend Streak Data Integration (Estimated time: 3 days)
Update database schema to track goal completion and streak history.
Implement API endpoints to fetch streak data for dashboard.

3. Dashboard Filtering Features (Estimated time: 2 days)
Enable filtering by goal type (workout, nutrition, or both).
Enable filtering by completion status (all, partial, none).

4. Exception Handling (Estimated time: 1 day)
Verify offline mode retrieves cached streak history.
Ensure proper prompts appear when no goals exist or backend is unreachable.

# Team Report

## Last Week’s Goals
- Complete UI design in Figma for all major screens
- Finalize feature set and high-level product direction
- Establish team workflow and communication patterns
- Familiarize everyone with their roles and responsibilities

## Progress and Issues
Accomplishments:
- UI Design Completed: The UI/UX team (Zihao, Oliver, Harry) successfully created comprehensive Figma designs covering all major screens including onboarding, meal logging, workout tracking, dashboard, and insights views
- Design System Established: Created a cohesive component library following Modo's minimalist philosophy with defined colors, typography, and spacing guidelines
- Team Workflow Defined: Successfully established communication channels on Discord and coordinated initial planning sessions
- Feature Set Refined: Responded to feedback about initial feature simplicity by expanding scope to include ModoCoach (AI accountability partner), achievement/badge system, and smart stats dashboard

Challenges:

- Initial feedback indicated features were too basic compared to market competitors
- Resolved: Expanded feature set with gamification (badges), personalized coaching system (ModoCoach), and comprehensive stats dashboard to differentiate Modo while maintaining simplicity
- Need to ensure expanded features don't compromise the core minimalist philosophy

## Plans and Goals for the Next Week
Frontend Team (Zihao, Oliver, Harry):

- Implement authentication screens (signup, login, onboarding) with Firebase integration
- Build main navigation structure with tab bar for all major sections
- Set up SwiftData models for local data caching
- Create basic profile screen displaying user stats and empty badge section
- Deliverable: Working app skeleton where users can sign up, onboard, and navigate between tabs

Backend Team (Maya, Shelby):

- Deploy Firebase Authentication (email/password + Sign in with Apple) to staging
- Create user profile Cloud Functions that trigger on signup
- Set up Cloud Storage buckets and security rules for future meal photos
- Implement initial Firestore security rules ensuring users only access their own data
- Deliverable: Sign up and login authentication should fully function

Product & Testing (Leo):

- Conduct daily integration testing of signup → onboarding → profile flow
- Coordinate staging deployment between frontend and backend teams
- Document bugs and facilitate debugging sessions

## Member 2: Zihao

### Last Week’s Goals
- *(Copy from last week’s “Plans and goals for the next week.” Leave empty for the first week.)*

### Progress and Issues
- Drew multiple UIs on Figma, including:
  - User login
  - Info gathering
  - Achievement
  - Help & Support
  - Main page of the To-Do section
  - Insight page
- Learned how to:
  - Use library resources in Figma for the project
  - Use AI tools to create prototype versions
  - Add basic interactions (e.g., scrolling, navigation)
- Initial trouble implementing scrolling, resolved by watching YouTube tutorials
- Some layouts appeared immature or visually unappealing, improved through multiple iterations and feedback from PM
- No major blockers or areas of being stuck

### Plans and Goals for the Next Week
- Implement the beginner interface (first screen users see when opening the app)
  - Create login, password recovery, and register interfaces (2 days)
  - Implement interactions between these interfaces (2 days)
  - Collaborate with backend to connect requests and responses (2 days)


## Member 3: Harry

### Last Week’s Goals

### Progress and Issues
- Helped review and finalize the core feature set to align frontend priorities with overall vision of app
- Set up local development environment, Git workflow, and Xcode project structure
  - Learned basics of SwiftUI layout and state management from onboarding documentation
  - Established Git branching workflow and tested feature branch creation
- Learned how Figma designs translate into SwiftUI components and began planning the navigation hierarchy
- Faced some initial uncertainty on feature prioritization and on a standout feature when discussing design

### Plans and Goals for the Next Week
- Implement main navigation and tab structure
  - Set up tab view for Dashboard, Calendar, AI Chat, and Settings (1.5 days)
  - Connect navigation flow between each page (0.5 days)
  - Integrate Figma design system into SwiftUI components (1 day)


## Member 4: Oliver

### Last Week’s Goals

### Progress and Issues
- What I did:
  - Designed multiple UI screens in Figma, including home page, profile page, progress page, settings page, add task page, and calendar modal
  - Refined design philosophy from purple theme to minimalist black-white-gray color scheme
  - Implemented consistent component library with unified spacing, rounded corners, and typography
  - Created interactive prototypes demonstrating screen transitions and user flows
- What worked:
  - The simplified black-white-gray color palette created a more premium aesthetic compared to the initial purple theme
  - Using Figma component variants and auto-layout significantly improved design consistency across screens
  - Collaboration with PM (Leo) and design team (Zihao, Harry) helped iterate quickly on feedback
- What I learned:
  - How to use Figma advanced features including component variants, auto-layout, and prototyping interactions
  - The importance of color psychology in creating a premium feel - sometimes less is more
  - How to balance functional design with aesthetic appeal
- Where I had trouble:
  - Initial purple color scheme felt too complex and not premium enough
  - Took time to master Figma's component system and prototyping tools
- Where I am stuck:
  - None currently - design phase is complete and ready to move into implementation

### Plans and Goals for the Next Week
- Build authentication and navigation (3 days)
  - Create login and signup screens with Firebase Authentication
  - Implement tab bar navigation structure
  - Set up screen routing and transitions
- Develop task management features (2 days)

## Member 6: Shelby

### Last Week’s Goals
- *(Copy from last week’s “Plans and goals for the next week.” Leave empty for the first week.)*

### Progress and Issues
- *(Describe what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.)*
I defined the actors, triggers, preconditions, postconditions, and success scenario for the streak tracking use case. This included detailing the step-by-step flow for logging activity, checking goals, and displaying streaks with fire symbols. I also outlined the extensions and variations where users can filter by goal type or completion, and the exceptions in which behavior does not work as intended.

The success scenario clearly shows the interaction between the user, AI, and backend. The fire symbol mechanic effectively conveys streak progress visually. Furthermore, the ability to filter by goal type or completion status adds flexibility to the dashboard.

Defining clear preconditions and postconditions ensures the system behaves predictably. Including AI feedback recommendations based on streak data can enhance user engagement. Exception handling is crucial for real-world usage so we need to be sure to know how to handle offline mode, empty history, and world.

There is the issue of correctly visualizing how the fire symbol scales dynamically with goal completion. And I am unsure if there are other factors regarding this “streak tracker” system where badges will also be rewarded in other instances that were not accounted for. We also need to figure out how AI feedback should integrate without overwhelming the user.

We need to figure out the algorithm for scaling fire symbols based on multiple goal completions. We also need to decide the backend data structure decisions to efficiently store and retrieve streak history for AI analysis.

### Plans and Goals for the Next Week
- *(List measurable tasks with time estimates.)*
  - *(No single task should exceed 3 days.)*
  - *(If tasks roll over, explain blockers and update estimates.)*
1. Finalize Fire Symbol Scaling Algorithm (Estimated time: 2 days)
Define formula for scaling based on number of completed goals.
Implement prototype visualization for testing.

2. Backend Streak Data Integration (Estimated time: 3 days)
Update database schema to track goal completion and streak history.
Implement API endpoints to fetch streak data for dashboard.

3. Dashboard Filtering Features (Estimated time: 2 days)
Enable filtering by goal type (workout, nutrition, or both).
Enable filtering by completion status (all, partial, none).

4. Exception Handling (Estimated time: 1 day)
Verify offline mode retrieves cached streak history.
Ensure proper prompts appear when no goals exist or backend is unreachable.

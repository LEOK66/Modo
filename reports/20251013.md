# Team Report

## Last Week’s Goals
- Complete UI design in Figma for all major screens
- Finalize feature set and high-level product direction
- Establish team workflow and communication patterns
- Familiarize everyone with their roles and responsibilities

## Progress and Issues
Accomplishments:
- UI Design Completed: The UI/UX team (Zihao, Oliver, Harry) successfully created comprehensive Figma designs covering all major screens including onboarding, meal logging, workout tracking, dashboard, and insights views
- Design System Established: Created a cohesive component library following Modo's minimalist philosophy with defined colors, typography, and spacing guidelines
- Team Workflow Defined: Successfully established communication channels on Discord and coordinated initial planning sessions
- Feature Set Refined: Responded to feedback about initial feature simplicity by expanding scope to include ModoCoach (AI accountability partner), achievement/badge system, and smart stats dashboard

Challenges:

- Initial feedback indicated features were too basic compared to market competitors
- Resolved: Expanded feature set with gamification (badges), personalized coaching system (ModoCoach), and comprehensive stats dashboard to differentiate Modo while maintaining simplicity
- Need to ensure expanded features don't compromise the core minimalist philosophy

## Plans and Goals for the Next Week
Frontend Team (Zihao, Oliver, Harry):

- Implement authentication screens (signup, login, onboarding) with Firebase integration
- Build main navigation structure with tab bar for all major sections
- Set up SwiftData models for local data caching
- Create basic profile screen displaying user stats and empty badge section
- Deliverable: Working app skeleton where users can sign up, onboard, and navigate between tabs

Backend Team (Maya, Shelby):

- Deploy Firebase Authentication (email/password + Sign in with Apple) to staging
- Create user profile Cloud Functions that trigger on signup
- Set up Cloud Storage buckets and security rules for future meal photos
- Implement initial Firestore security rules ensuring users only access their own data
- Deliverable: Sign up and login authentication should fully function

Product & Testing (Leo):

- Conduct daily integration testing of signup → onboarding → profile flow
- Coordinate staging deployment between frontend and backend teams
- Document bugs and facilitate debugging sessions

I defined the actors, triggers, preconditions, postconditions, and success scenario for the streak tracking use case. This included detailing the step-by-step flow for logging activity, checking goals, and displaying streaks with fire symbols. I also outlined the extensions and variations where users can filter by goal type or completion, and the exceptions in which behavior does not work as intended.

The success scenario clearly shows the interaction between the user, AI, and backend. The fire symbol mechanic effectively conveys streak progress visually. Furthermore, the ability to filter by goal type or completion status adds flexibility to the dashboard.

Defining clear preconditions and postconditions ensures the system behaves predictably. Including AI feedback recommendations based on streak data can enhance user engagement. Exception handling is crucial for real-world usage so we need to be sure to know how to handle offline mode, empty history, and world.

There is the issue of correctly visualizing how the fire symbol scales dynamically with goal completion. And I am unsure if there are other factors regarding this “streak tracker” system where badges will also be rewarded in other instances that were not accounted for. We also need to figure out how AI feedback should integrate without overwhelming the user.

We need to figure out the algorithm for scaling fire symbols based on multiple goal completions. We also need to decide the backend data structure decisions to efficiently store and retrieve streak history for AI analysis.

1. Finalize Fire Symbol Scaling Algorithm (Estimated time: 2 days)
Define formula for scaling based on number of completed goals.
Implement prototype visualization for testing.

2. Backend Streak Data Integration (Estimated time: 3 days)
Update database schema to track goal completion and streak history.
Implement API endpoints to fetch streak data for dashboard.

3. Dashboard Filtering Features (Estimated time: 2 days)
Enable filtering by goal type (workout, nutrition, or both).
Enable filtering by completion status (all, partial, none).

4. Exception Handling (Estimated time: 1 day)
Verify offline mode retrieves cached streak history.
Ensure proper prompts appear when no goals exist or backend is unreachable.

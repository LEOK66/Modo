# Team Report

## Last Week's Goals
- Prep the repo for the peer reviews due next Tuesday with clear and complete documentation covering all the desired bullet points
- Flesh out the front-end design and pages for achivements, streak, and badge system
- Complete the interegration of macro tracking, using the same open source api currently used for calories

## Progress and Issues
Accomplishments:
- Achivements, streak, and badge system designs are complete, currently working on their frontend implementation
- Backend logic complete for grabbing macro data as well as well as static frontend to display them, currently integrated the frontend with backend so that updates accordingly

Issues: 
- People peer reviewing our project had issues running our application because they were missing the firebase config info which is something we overlooked when prepping the repo for the peer review, it has been fixed accordingly now

Challenges:
- No major challenges this week - team collaboration and workflow are running smoothly

## Plans and Goals for the Next Week
- Continue to implement the achivements, streak, and badge system, hopefully aiming to finish by next week, the same can be said for the macro tracking as well
- Take in the feedback from the peer review and address all the areas of concerns raised as issues by fellow students

## Member 5: Maya

### Last Week’s Goals
- still trying to get firebase emulator set up, workflow keeps failing when i try (2 days)
- touch base to see what other backend things to work on (1 day)
### Progress and Issues
- wans't able to figure out the firebase emulator, but have put that on the backburner and am now working on extended the open source api we are using for calories to also get info about macros (proteins, carbs, fats) and integrating that with our frontend so it is dynamically tracked and updated
- was able to get all the backend logic set up and static mock front end, but am unable to test if it dynamically updates bc for some reason the instance of the app that is running on my machine isn't allowing me to create and store tasks, going to ask my team about it when we meet on tuesday
### Plans and Goals for the Next Week
- finish integrating the backend macro information with frontend (3 days)
- test this new feature once fully implemented (2 days)
